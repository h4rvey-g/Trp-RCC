# Project Brief: Bioinformatic Analysis of Renal Cell Carcinoma

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. The analysis aims to identify differentially expressed genes, characterize cellular heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment, and uncover key biological pathways and molecular signatures associated with RCC. The ultimate goal is to generate actionable insights into the pathobiology of this cancer.

## 2. Key Technologies and Tools

*   **Primary Language:** R
*   **Workflow Management:** The project will use the `{targets}` package in R to manage the entire analytical workflow. This ensures the pipeline is reproducible, efficient, and scalable.
*   **Core Libraries:** Analysis will adhere to best practices by leveraging established packages from the Bioconductor project (e.g., `DESeq2` for bulk RNA-seq, `Seurat` or `SingleCellExperiment` for scRNA-seq) and the Tidyverse ecosystem for data manipulation and visualization.

## 3. Core Data Types

The analysis will be based on two primary types of genomic data:

*   **Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq):** Used to analyze gene expression profiles from bulk tumor tissue samples. This provides an overall view of the transcriptomic landscape.
*   **Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq):** Used to dissect the cellular composition of the tumor and its microenvironment at a single-cell resolution, allowing for the identification of distinct cell populations (e.g., cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts) and their specific gene expression patterns.

## 4. Project Structure and Conventions

To maintain a clean and organized workspace, the project adheres to the following directory structure rules:

*   **Analysis Scripts:** All R scripts performing analysis will be located in the project's analysis directory (e.g., `/analysis` or `/R`).
*   **Generated Data:** All intermediate or processed data files generated by the analysis pipelines (e.g., normalized count matrices, RDS objects containing analysis results) will be saved to the `./data/` directory.
*   **Final Results:** All final outputs intended for reporting or visualization (e.g., plots, tables, reports) will be saved to the `./result/` directory. Each analysis script will save its corresponding results into a dedicated subfolder named after the script itself (e.g., results from `01_dge_analysis.R` will go into `./result/01_dge_analysis/`).
